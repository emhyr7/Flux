FLUX: DATA-PARALLEL CONSTANT-TIME SCRIPTING ENGINE.
---------------------------------------------------

Flux is an engine that executes a script in a data-parallel and constant-time
manner for those who value performance and predictability.

STATUS
------

Currently, it is a prototype written in Java as a project for school. It is
capable of compiling and interpreting a script written in a custom Forth-like
language.

Later, it will be rewritten to C and GLSL and development will continue
thereafter.

This implementation is written in a way to make rewritting it in C and GLSL
easier.
