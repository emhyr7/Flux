[ ] compress source.


	mark bytes by either space or letter.
	if there is a single letter, mark its next byte as a letter.
	at this point, there are 2 different markers:
		- 0: space.
		- 1: letter.
	we then sort such that the letters are moved to the front, and
	the spaces are moved to the back.

	scanning a word would then just be reading 2 bytes.
